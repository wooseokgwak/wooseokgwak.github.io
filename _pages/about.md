Hi, I am a senior undergraduate at `KAIST` (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Currently, I am a research intern at the CASYS lab in KAIST, advised by [Prof. Youngjin Kwon](https://sites.google.com/view/yjkwon/home). 


Previously, I have worked on research projects including:

- **Project DynoSpec**, focusing on accelerating speculative decoding through model colocation. 

- **Project TETRIS**, a serving system enabling dynamic parallel scaling for LLM by assigning adaptive configuration using RL.

- **Project BudAlloc**, focusing on defeating Use-After-Free bugs by decoupling virtual address management from kernel. Utilized eBPF to remove semantic gap.

If you’re interested in discussing research, or exploring collaboration opportunities, I’d love to connect — don’t hesitate to reach out to me at wooseok428@kaist.ac.kr !
