Hi, I am a senior undergraduate at `KAIST` (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Currently, I am a research intern at the CASYS lab in KAIST, advised by [Prof. Youngjin Kwon](https://sites.google.com/view/yjkwon/home). 


Previously, I have worked on research projects including:

- **Project DynoSpec**: a serving system for speculative decoding that accelerates LLM inference by dynamically colocating models.

- **Project TETRIS**: a serving system that enables dynamic parallel scaling for LLMs. It assigns adaptive scaling configurations using reinforcement learning.

- **Project BudAlloc**: One Time memory Allocator (OTA) that mitigates use-after-free (UAF) bugs by decoupling virtual address management from the kernel. It leverages eBPF to reduce the semantic gap.

If you’re interested in discussing research, or exploring collaboration opportunities, I’d love to connect — don’t hesitate to reach out to me at `wooseok428@kaist.ac.kr` !
